# Kubernetes
> Kubernetes is a container management system, It runs and manages containerized applications on a cluster.

## architecture 构架 

Things that Kubernetes can do for us

* Basic autoscaling

* Blue/green deployment, canary deployment

* Long running services, but also batch (one-off) jobs

* Overcommit our cluster and evict low-priority jobs

* Run services with stateful data (databases etc.)

* Fine-grained access control defining what can be done by whom on which resources

* Integrating third party services (service catalog)

* Automating complex tasks (operators)
